(+)-alaproclate,A small molecule ApoE4-targeted therapeutic candidate that normalizes sirtuin 1 levels and improves cognition in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,30514854,10.1038/s41598-018-35687-8,,2018,animal,negative,0,3,amyloid;tau;cognition,"We describe here the results from the testing of a small molecule first-in-class apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4)-targeted sirtuin1 (SirT1) enhancer, A03, that increases the levels of the neuroprotective enzyme SirT1 while not affecting levels of neurotoxic sirtuin 2 (SirT2) in vitro in ApoE4-transfected cells. A03 was identified by high-throughput screening (HTS) and found to be orally bioavailable and brain penetrant. In vivo, A03 treatment increased SirT1 levels in the hippocampus of 5XFAD-ApoE4 (E4FAD) Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice and elicited cognitive improvement while inducing no observed toxicity. We were able to resolve the enantiomers of A03 and show using in vitro models that the L-enantiomer was more potent than the corresponding D-enantiomer in increasing SirT1 levels. ApoE4 expression has been shown to decrease the level of the NAD-dependent deacetylase and major longevity determinant SirT1 in brain tissue and serum of AD patients as compared to normal controls. A deficiency in SirT1 level has been recently implicated in increased tau acetylation, a dominant post-translational modification and key pathological event in AD and tauopathies. Therefore, as a novel approach to therapeutic development for AD, we targeted identification of compounds that enhance and normalize brain SirT1 levels."

Disrupted metal homeostasis-especially copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe)-is implicated in AD pathogenesis, contributing to amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation and oxidative stress. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-toxic phytocannabinoid with antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, has unclear effects on brain metal regulation. Using high-resolution laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA‑ICP‑MS), we quantified regional metal distributions in sagittal brain sections from 12‑month‑old female wild‑type (WT) and APP/PS1 transgenic mice treated chronically with CBD or vehicle. CBD significantly elevated whole‑brain Cu in WT mice but not in APP/PS1 mice. Although Zn and Fe concentrations did not differ significantly, effect-size trends revealed regional differences in Cu and Zn patterns across treatment groups, particularly in the hippocampus. Correlation analysis revealed coordinated inter‑regional metal regulation in WT and vehicle‑treated APP/PS1 groups, which was disrupted in CBD‑treated APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, CBD‑treated WT mice exhibited increased variance in cerebellar Cu, suggesting individual differences in response. These findings suggest that CBD influences Cu homeostasis in WT animals, though not significantly altered in transgenic animals under the conditions tested. Our results support integrating spatially resolved metallomics into preclinical AD frameworks and highlight the utility of metrics beyond mean concentration-such as regional ratios, correlation structures, and variability-for detecting subtle treatment effects."
(+)-cannabidiol,Basic Science and Pathogenesis.,41454444,10.1002/alz70855_102846,,2025,animal,negative,0,1,amyloid;cognition,"<h4>Background</h4>Previous results demonstrated that chronic treatment with a combination of two natural cannabinoids, Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), at non-psychotropic doses reduces cognitive decline, as well as the extracellular glutamate levels and the basal excitability in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate whether this modulation of hippocampal excitability exerted by natural cannabinoids could affect the dopaminergic activity in limbic areas related to non-cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our animal model.<h4>Method</h4>We used glutamate and dopamine biosensors, along with fiber photometry techniques, to evaluate the levels of these neurotransmitters in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens (NAcc), respectively. Experiments were conducted in anaesthetized animals for recording under an electrical hippocampal stimulation protocol, or in awake animals for recording during behavioral evaluations (novel object recognition, open field, sociability and prepulse inhibition tests).<h4>Result</h4>Chronic treatment with THC and CBD reversed the increased prominence and frequency of glutamate peaks observed in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 animals during the novel object recognition test at early stages of the AD-like process. At more advanced stages, APP/PS1 mice exhibited alterations in dopamine dynamics in the NAcc, which were compatible with psychotic-like traits observed in this animal model of AD. Interestingly, these alterations were partially modulated by chronic treatment with these natural cannabinoids.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results reveal that the combination of THC and CBD modulates glutamatergic activity in the hippocampus at early stages of the AD process and that, likely related to this, reduces dopaminergic alterations in limbic areas at advanced stages. Thus, these natural cannabinoids may alleviate both cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms occurring in AD, supporting their clinical development as a pleiotropic therapeutic alternative for this neurodegenerative disease."

Emerging preclinical research has explored the potential of this cannabinoid as a therapeutic agent to delay or prevent the onset of symptoms and pathophysiological features of neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CBD treatment during aging of an animal model for AD using positron emission tomography (PET).<h4>Method</h4>Male and female 3xTg-AD mice (ethics committee 1811/2022) were divided into control and CBD groups. At 7 months-old, the animals were treated with CBD (20 mg/kg) or vehicle for 30 days. At 4, 8, 12 and 18 months-old, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195 PET images were acquired to assess brain metabolism and neuroinflammation. The standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated for the whole brain. The behavioral tests of novel object recognition (NOR) and elevated plus maze (EPM) were performed to assess memory, exploratory behavior and anxiety.<h4>Result</h4>There was a sex effect on [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake, with vehicle-males showing higher uptake than vehicle-females at 4 (p = 0.02), 8 (p = 0.007), and 18 months (p <0.0001). Vehicle-females had reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake at 18 months compared to all other ages (18 months vs: 4: p = 0.045; 8: p = 0.001; 12: p <0.0001). In the CBD group, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake was higher in males than in females at 8 months (p = 0.002). CBD-males also had increased uptake from 4 to 8 months (p <0.0001) and to 12 months (p = 0.002). In addition, CBD-females had higher [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake than vehicle-females at 18 months (p = 0.024). No sex effect was observed for [<sup>11</sup>C]PK11195. Increased uptake was observed in the control group at 18 months compared to 4 months (p = 0.004) and 12 months (p = 0.02). No significant differences were observed in the behavioral assessments.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study demonstrated prominent sex differences in brain metabolism and provided evidence of a possible neuroprotective role of CBD in mitigating neuroinflammatory events associated with aging. Furthermore, PET proved to be a more sensitive tool for detecting aging-induced changes in the 3xTg-AD model compared to behavioral assessments."

Current treatments are largely symptomatic, necessitating novel neuroprotective strategies.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of chitosan-cannabidiol (CS-CBD) nanoparticles in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of AD.MethodsSixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, AD model (STZ-induced), chitosan-treated, cannabidiol-treated, and CS-CBD-treated. AD was induced by intracerebroventricular injection of STZ (3 mg/kg). Treatments were administered intranasally for 21 days. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Morris water maze. After treatment, oxidative stress markers (NO, FRAP), liver enzymes (ALT, AST), and the expression of inflammatory and neuroprotective genes (IL1β, IL6, IL10, iNOS, PPARγ, BDNF) were evaluated by real-time PCR. Histological analysis of the hippocampus was also performed. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test (p < 0.05).ResultsThe AD group showed significant impairments in memory and learning (p < 0.0001), increased oxidative stress, and upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes (IL1β, iNOS), with decreased neuroprotective markers (BDNF, PPARγ). CS-CBD treatment significantly improved cognitive function (p < 0.001), restored oxidative balance, reduced IL1β and iNOS expression, and elevated BDNF and PPARγ expression (p < 0.05). Histological analysis confirmed reduced neuronal degeneration and increased neuronal density in the CS-CBD group.ConclusionsCS-CBD nanoparticles exerted potent neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects in an STZ-induced rat model of AD. These findings support the potential of CS-CBD nanoparticles as a promising adjunctive therapy for AD, warranting further investigation."

The phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) has been found to reverse impairments of recognition as well as spatial memory deficits of AD transgenic mice but had only limited effects on disease-relevant brain pathologies. Recent evidence suggests that combining CBD with other cannabinoids including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may lead to improved therapeutic outcomes. Thus, this study evaluated the chronic effects of combined treatment with 3 mg/kg THC and 20 mg/kg CBD on 14.5-month-old APP<sub>Swe</sub>/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic females and control littermates. Mice were treated with THCxCBD or vehicle (VEH) daily via intraperitoneal injections for 3 weeks before behavioural testing commenced. AD-relevant behavioural domains were analysed utilising Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), open field (OF), novel object recognition test (NORT), social interaction (SI), Y-maze (YM), and prepulse inhibition test (PPI). APP/PS1 females showed an anxiety-like phenotype and object recognition deficits that remained unchanged by cannabinoid treatment. Interestingly, some effects of THCxCBD appeared genotype-dependent with cannabinoid treatment causing an anxiogenic EPM response in APP/PS1 mice but having an anxiolytic-like effect in WT females. Moreover, THCxCBD administration disrupted the novel object preference of control females. Noteworthy, THCxCBD significantly decreased different fat depots and bodyweight of all mice across genotype. No other differences between genotypes or treatment groups were detected. In conclusion, the particular cannabinoid combination strategy utilised had no prominent therapeutic-like effect in 14.5-month-old APP/PS1 females."

CBD has been investigated for the treatment of anxiety, depression, epilepsy, neuroinflammation, and pain. Recently there has been an interest in CBD as a possible treatment for age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD). Here we tested the hypothesis that chronic CBD administration would improve learning and memory in the SAMP8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. SAMP8 mice aged 11 months (at the start of the study) were administered vehicle or CBD (3 or 30 mg/Kg) daily via oral gavage for 2 months. Vehicle-treated young SAMP8 mice (age 3 months at the start of the study) served as unimpaired controls. After 30 days of treatment (4 and 12 months of age), learning and memory, activity, anxiety, strength and dexterity were assessed. High dose CBD treatment significantly improved learning and memory of the 12-month-old mice in the T maze. Novel object recognition memory was also improved by CBD in aged CBD treated mice. Aged CBD treated mice also displayed less anxiety in the elevated plus maze test compared to controls. However, activity and strength levels were similar between groups. Biochemical analysis revealed decreased markers of oxidative stress, providing a possible mechanism by which CBD treatment impacts learning, memory, and anxiety. These results highlight the potential use of CBD as a therapeutic for age related cognitive impairment and dementia."

The autoinflammatory hypothesis of AD suggests chronic immune dysfunction contributes to neuronal damage, making immune modulation a promising therapeutic strategy. Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid with anti-inflammatory properties, may offer therapeutic potential. This study investigates how CBD independently influences two key neuroinflammatory regulators in AD: the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) pathway. Though mechanistically distinct, both shape CNS immune responses. Targeting these immune-metabolic axes provides a mechanistic alternative to amyloid- or tau-based approaches by addressing upstream drivers of neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation. Using the male 5XFAD transgenic AD mouse model, we administered CBD via inhalation and assessed IDO and cGAS expression using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence (IF), and gene expression analysis. We evaluated cytokine levels and used STRING-based bioinformatics to identify CBD-target interactions. CBD treatment significantly reduced IDO and cGAS expression, correlating with decreased proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ. Bioinformatics identified potential interactions between CBD and immune targets such as AKT1, TRPV1, and GPR55. These targets were prioritized based on their roles in neuroinflammatory signaling and high-confidence interactions with CBD. AKT1 regulates inflammatory signaling and cell survival, TRPV1 modulates nociception and neuroinflammation, and GPR55 influences immune cell activation. These findings support CBD as a potential monotherapy or adjunctive treatment for AD by targeting distinct neuroinflammatory pathways, including IDO and cGAS. Further studies are warranted to fully explore its therapeutic potential."

The precise molecular profile of AD onset with insight for major pathological contributors remains unclear with corresponding impedances in therapeutic development. The current study sought two objectives, as (i) to resolve the molecular pathogenesis from cognitive impairment to the onset of AD-like neuropathology and (ii) whether the novel agent cannabidiol (CBD), noted for its neuroprotective effects, influences the molecular transition associated with AD onset.<h4>Methods</h4>Dietary CBD was administered daily (80-100 mg/kg/day) in male <i>3xTg-AD</i> mice and wild-type B6129SF2/J animals from 4.5 to 6.5 mo of age with inclusion of vehicle controls. RNA sequencing encompassed longitudinal and cross-sectional blood and brain samples, respectively. Metabolomics and behavioral analyses examined brain regions (cortex, hippocampus) and associated integrated neurocircuitry.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>There were >1,000 differentially expressed markers of AD onset, whereby >75% were either eliminated or reversed in the direction of expression in response to CBD. Signaling pathways encompassed synaptic development and plasticity (e.g., Foxp2), neurovascular interactions (Smad9, Angptl6), receptors and ion channels (Gria4, Chrna2, Rgs7/Rgs7bp), mitochondrial genes (Ndufa7, Cox7a2), immunity (Ncr1), oxidation-reduction (Esr1), lipid synthesis (Fasn, ApoE), and carbohydrate metabolism (Mafa, Mlxipl). As potentially addressable with CBD treatment, AD onset represents molecular integration of neurovascular interactions, channelopathies, metabolic disturbances, and aberrations in developmental genes with involvement of major pathological contributors such as inflammation, oxidative signaling, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance."

Interactions between the gut and central nervous system (microbiota-gut-brain axis) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorder AD. At present investigations into the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective action of CBD in AD are not conclusive. The aim of this study was thus to examine the influence of CBD on cognition and involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis using a senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) model. Data demonstrated that administration of CBD to SAMP8 mice improved cognitive function as evidenced from the Morris water maze test and increased hippocampal activated microglia shift from M1 to M2. In addition, CBD elevated levels of Bacteriodetes associated with a fall in Firmicutes providing morphologically a protective intestinal barrier which subsequently reduced leakage of intestinal toxic metabolites. Further, CBD was found to reduce the levels of hippocampal and colon epithelial cells lipopolysaccharide (LPS), known to be increased in AD leading to impaired gastrointestinal motility, thereby promoting neuroinflammation and subsequent neuronal death. Our findings demonstrated that CBD may be considered a beneficial therapeutic drug to counteract AD-mediated cognitive impairment and restore gut microbial functions associated with the observed neuroprotective mechanisms."

Cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabis-derived phytocannabinoid with potential health benefits, including reports from our laboratory and others showing a therapeutic role in the pre-clinical treatment of AD; however, the mechanisms whereby CBD affects AD progression remain undefined. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are recently discovered immune cells that initiate and orchestrate inflammatory responses. ILC2, a sub-class of ILCs, is proposed to have a role in cognitive function via unknown mechanisms. In this present study, we explored whether CBD ameliorates AD symptoms via the enhancement of acetylcholine (ACh), a cholinergic neurotransmitter involved in cognition that may regulate ILC2. 5xFAD mice were chronically treated by inhalation of a formulation of broad-spectrum CBD for seven months. ACh production, ILC2s profile, brain histopathology, and long-term behavior were assessed. Together, our studies showed that long-term inhalation of CBD improved cognitive function and reduced senile plaques in a murine AD model, effects that were associated with enhanced ACh production and altered ILC2s distribution within the CNS. These findings indicate that inhaled CBD could offer a cost-effective, non-invasive, and effective treatment for managing AD. The beneficial effects of CBD inhalation may be linked to increased ACh production and an altered distribution of ILC2s, highlighting the need for further research in this area."

Moreover, CBD treatment was shown to reduce neuroinflammation, as CBD was able to skew microglia towards a neuroprotective M2 phenotype while attenuating proinflammatory cytokine release in the 5xFAD AD mouse model. Notably, daily CBD injections (10 mg/Kg) for 28 days in 5xFAD mice resulted in significant improvements in both short- and long-term spatial memory. The study also reveals CBD's capacity to partially revert neurite formation loss induced by Aβ, Tau, and pTau proteins, suggesting a potential role in promoting neuronal plasticity. Additionally, CBD treatment led to a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and increased neuronal viability in the presence of AD-associated protein aggregates.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These multifaceted effects of CBD, ranging from molecular-level modulation to behavioral improvements, underscore its potential as a comprehensive therapeutic approach for AD. The findings not only support CBD's neuroprotective properties but also highlight its ability to target multiple pathological processes simultaneously, offering a promising avenue for future AD treatment strategies."

Yet, unlike epilepsy, epileptiform activity is not always observed in AD, leading to skepticism. Historically, this absence has been attributed to limited recording depth or insufficient recording duration. We tested an alternative hypothesis that certain types of epileptiform activity, specifically high frequency oscillations (HFOs, defined as 250-500 Hz fast ripples), inhibit interictal spikes (IIS), which are currently used to assess hyperexcitability clinically. We recorded wideband (0.1-500 Hz) hippocampal local field potentials in three AD (Tg2576, Presenilin 2<sup>-/-</sup>, Ts65Dn Down syndrome model) and two epilepsy (intrahippocampal kainic acid, pilocarpine) mouse models during wakefulness and sleep. In both AD and epilepsy, HFOs consistently outnumbered IIS across behavioral states, age and recording contact. However, IIS and HFOs showed divergent relationships: a negative correlation between their rates was observed only in AD, in contrast to a positive correlation in epilepsy. HFOs preceded IIS at much shorter intervals in epilepsy than in AD. Co-occurrence of IIS with ripples did not differ between AD and epilepsy. These findings reveal a novel dissociation between clinically-relevant EEG biomarkers in AD and epilepsy. In AD, HFOs may inhibit IIS, which could lead to underestimation of hyperexcitability and hinder patient stratification for anti-seizure therapies. While non-invasive HFO detection remains challenging, we stress the need for wideband EEG/MEG, particularly in AD, to assess the full extent of hyperexcitability and biomarker interactions that would otherwise remain undetected."

To shed light on their possible treatment options, we assessed the effect of drugs with variable and known mechanisms of action on the occurrence of SWDs in aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. The treatments included prototypic antiepileptic drugs (ethosuximide and levetiracetam), donepezil as the typical Alzheimer drug and atropine as an antagonistic effect, GABA<sub>B</sub> antagonist CGP-35348, and alternate energy substrates beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), pyruvate and lactate on the occurrence of SWDs in aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. All agents were administered by single intraperitoneal injections at doses earlier documented to be effective and response was assessed by recording 3 h of video-EEG. Atropine at 25 mg/kg significantly decreased SWD occurrence in all behavioral states, and also resulted in altered frequency composition of SWDs and general EEG slowing during sleep. Ethosuximide at 200 mg/kg and levetiracetam at 75 mg/kg effectively suppressed SWDs only during a period of mixed behavioral states, but levetiracetam also increased SWDs in sleep. BHB at 1 g/kg decreased SWDs in sleep, while both pyruvate and lactate at the same dose tended to increase SWD number and total duration. Unexpectantly, donepezil at 0.3 mg/kg CGP-35348 at 100 mg/kg had no effect on SWDs. These findings call for re-evaluation of some prevailing theories on neural circuit alternations that underlie SWD generation and show the utility of APP/PS1 mice for testing potential new treatments for nonconvulsive epileptic activity related to Alzheimer pathology."

The CCK-8, LDH, neurosphere formation, and BrdU incorporation assays were employed to identify the most effective bioactive metabolite of EF in promoting NSC proliferation. Subsequently, JC-1 staining, ATP quantification, and ROS assays were conducted to evaluate the protective effects of Icariside II (ICS II)-identified as the most effective metabolite-on mitochondrial function. APP/PS1 transgenic mice received an oral administration of 10 mg/kg ICS II for 7 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze and nest-building tests, while H&E and Nissl staining were used to evaluate brain tissue pathology. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examined the ultrastructural integrity of hippocampal neurons, immunofluorescence assessed hippocampal neurogenesis, and Western blotting quantified proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics. Additionally, Rotenone (Rot), a mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor, was applied to disrupt mitochondrial function, allowing an evaluation of whether the neurogenesis-promoting effect of ICS II depends on maintaining mitochondrial structure and function.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>The results demonstrated that ICS II exhibited the strongest capacity to promote APP-NSC proliferation (P < 0.01, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.845), followed by Icariin and Icaritin. ICS II treatment significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits (<i>P</i> < 0.01, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.883), neuronal damage, and impairments in neurogenesis in adult APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, ICS II rescued mitochondrial damage by upregulating fusion proteins (Mfn1 and Mfn2) and downregulating fission proteins (p-Drp1/Drp1 and Mff); however, these protective effects were negated by Rot administration. In conclusion, this study identifies ICS II as one of the most effective metabolites of EF, promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice, thereby offering promising therapeutic potential for AD."

Curcumin has been reported to reduce cell apoptosis and stimulate neurogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the influence of curcumin on adult neurogenesis in AD mice and its potential mechanism. Two-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were injected with soluble β-amyloid (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>) using lateral ventricle stereolocalization to establish AD models. An immunofluorescence assay, including bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), doublecortin (DCX), and neuron-specific nuclear antigen (NeuN), was used to detect hippocampal neurogenesis. Western blot and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to test the expression of related proteins and the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A Morris water maze was used to detect the cognitive function of the mice. Our results showed that curcumin administration (100 mg/kg) rescued the impaired neurogenesis of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> mice, shown as enhanced BrdU<sup>+</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup> and BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells in DG. In addition, curcumin regulated the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) -mediated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) /Wingless/Integrated (Wnt)/β-catenin pathway and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB)/BDNF in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> mice. Inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin and depriving BDNF could reverse both the upregulated neurogenesis and cognitive function of curcumin-treated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> mice. In conclusion, our study indicates that curcumin, through targeting PI3K/Akt, regulates GSK3β/Wnt/β-catenin and CREB/BDNF pathways, improving the adult neurogenesis of AD mice."

We recorded HFOs using wideband (0.1-500 Hz, 2 kHz) intra-hippocampal and cortical surface electroencephalography (EEG) at 1 month until 24 months of age during wakefulness, slow wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, interictal spikes (IISs) and seizures were analyzed for the possible presence of HFOs. Comparisons were made to the intra-hippocampal kainic acid and pilocarpine models of epilepsy.<h4>Results</h4>We describe for the first time that hippocampal and cortical HFOs are a new EEG abnormality in AD mouse models. HFOs occurred in all transgenic mice but no controls. They were also detectable as early as 1 month of age and prior to amyloid beta plaque neuropathology. HFOs were most frequent during SWS (vs REM sleep or wakefulness). Notably, HFOs in the AD and epilepsy models were indistinguishable in both spectral frequency and duration. HFOs also occurred during IISs and seizures in the AD models, although with altered spectral properties compared to isolated HFOs.<h4>Significance</h4>Our data demonstrate that HFOs, an epilepsy biomarker with high translational value, are not unique to epilepsy and thus not disease specific. Our findings also strengthen the idea of hyperexcitability in AD and its significant overlap with epilepsy. HFOs in AD mouse models may serve as an EEG biomarker, which is detectable from the scalp and thus amenable to noninvasive detection in people at risk for AD."

Specific anticonvulsant therapy reverses memory impairments in various transgenic mouse strains, but it is not known whether reduction of epileptiform activity might serve as a surrogate marker of drug efficacy for memory improvement in AD mouse models.<h4>Methods</h4>Transgenic AD mice (APP/PS1 and 3xTg-AD) were chronically implanted with dural electroencephalography electrodes, and epileptiform activity was correlated with spatial memory function and transgene-specific pathology. The antiepileptic drugs ethosuximide and brivaracetam were tested for their ability to suppress epileptiform activity and to reverse memory impairments and synapse loss in APP/PS1 mice.<h4>Results</h4>We report that in two transgenic mouse models of AD (APP/PS1 and 3xTg-AD), the presence of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) correlated with impairments in spatial memory. Both ethosuximide and brivaracetam reduce mouse SWDs, but only brivaracetam reverses memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data confirm an intriguing therapeutic role of anticonvulsant drugs targeting synaptic vesicle protein 2A across AD mouse models. Chronic ethosuximide dosing did not reverse spatial memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice, despite reduction of SWDs. Our data indicate that SWDs are not a reliable surrogate marker of appropriate target engagement for reversal of memory dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice."

Yet, whether and how neurons compensate for spine loss in AD remains largely unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a chromophore-assisted light inactivation (CALI) strategy to selectively eliminate dendritic spines to model this key feature of AD. Two-photon microscopy was used to monitor the structural plasticity of spines over time after spine elimination. Validation experiments were conducted in amyloid beta (Aβ)-driven models of synapse loss, including APP/PS1 mice and intracortical delivery of oligomeric Aβ.<h4>Results</h4>We discovered that dendritic spine elimination-induced either artificially or in Aβ models-triggers a two-stage compensatory response: rapid enlargement of remaining spines followed by delayed spine regeneration.<h4>Discussion</h4>These findings provide direct evidence that neurons retain an intrinsic capacity to reverse early synaptic loss in AD, potentially contributing to cognitive resilience.<h4>Highlights</h4>We developed a targeted optogenetic tool to selectively eliminate individual dendritic spines in live neurons, both in vitro and in vivo. We discovered a two-stage compensatory response to spine loss: rapid enlargement of surviving spines followed by delayed regeneration. We showed that the compensatory enlargement of dendritic spines depends on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation and protein synthesis. We validated across multiple Alzheimer's disease models, demonstrating that similar compensatory plasticity occurs after amyloid beta oligomer-induced synapse loss. We postulate that synaptic resilience is an active neuronal program rather than a passive byproduct of pathology."

Cigarette smoke (CS) contains a variety of toxic substances. Studies have found that nicotine, tar, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, etc. in CS can pass through the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain to exert their effects. Moreover, some existing studies have pointed out that CS exposure is closely related to the accelerated pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD).<h4>Methods</h4>Transgenic mice with the five familial AD mutations (5xFAD), which are 1-month-old, were used for chronic CS exposure for 100 days. Subsequently, cognitive function and behavioral changes were evaluated through morris water maze and new object recognition tests. The acceleration of pathological changes due to CS exposure was assessed by HE, Tunel and Aβ immunohistochemical staining. Differential expression proteins and metabolites were screened through hippocampal proteomics and metabolomics analyses. Finally, the expression levels of key proteins were verified by Western blot.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with unexposed 5xFAD mice, the behavioral results of mice showed that FAD mice after CS exposure exhibited poorer cognitive abilities, with longer latencies in the Morris water maze, and decreased time spent and entries in the target quadrant. The results of pathological sections indicated that the total nuclei density in the DG and CA3 regions of the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice decreased significantly after chronic CS exposure, the number of TUNEL-positive cells increased, and the expression of Aβ42 increased. Multi - omics analysis revealed that CS exposure up - regulated the expression of 46 proteins and down - regulated the expression of 80 proteins in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice, and caused changes in 92 metabolites. Analysis of the correlation between differential proteins and differential metabolites revealed six key cross-node proteins: Kng1, Hbb-b1, Fabp3, Apoa1, Ilk, and Apoa4.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CS exposure may accelerate pathological changes and cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice by affecting energy metabolism through the PPAR signaling pathway."

We have previously reported that the expression of copine-7 (Cpne7) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice is significantly upregulated by nicotine, whereas the potential role of CPNE7 in AD remains largely unknown. Here, we report that CPNE7 protein levels are significantly decreased in APP/PS1 mice and HEK293 cells stably expressing full-length APP. CPNE7 is shown to reduce Aβ levels by favoring ADAM10 activity, and the elevated ADAM10 protein by CPNE7 involves a translational mechanism. Further transcriptome profiling reveals that CPNE7 differentially regulates genes associated with neuronal function. Among these, cyclase-associated actin cytoskeleton regulatory protein 1 (CAP1) is identified as a target gene of CPNE7, which controls ADAM10 translation through binding to the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). Collectively, the CPNE7-CAP1 axis could be critical in the amyloidogenic pathway by regulating ADAM10 translation, in which the RNA binding activity of CAP1 is highlighted."

Using simultaneous hippocampal calcium imaging and electrophysiology in freely moving mice expressing human Aβ, here we show that Aβ aggregates perturbed neural systems in a state-dependent fashion, driving neuronal hyperactivity in exploratory behavior and slow wave sleep (SWS), yet suppressing activity in quiet wakefulness (QW) and REM sleep. In exploratory behavior and REM sleep, Aβ impaired hippocampal theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling and altered neuronal synchronization with theta. In SWS, Aβ reduced cortical slow oscillation (SO) power, the coordination of hippocampal sharp wave-ripples with both the SO and thalamocortical spindles, and the coordination of calcium transients with the sharp wave-ripple. Physostigmine improved Aβ-associated hyperactivity in exploratory behavior and hypoactivity in QW and expanded the range of gamma that coupled with theta phase, but exacerbated hypoactivity in exploratory behavior. Together, these findings show that the effects of Aβ alone on hippocampal circuit function are profoundly state dependent and suggest a reformulation of therapeutic strategies aimed at Aβ induced hyperexcitability."

However, as ranuncoside has not been evaluated for its antioxidant and anti-neuroinflammatory properties in any <i>in vivo</i> model, our study aimed to evaluate its neurotherapeutic efficacy against scopolamine-induced memory impairment in adult male albino mice. Mice were randomly divided into four experimental groups. Mice of group I was injected with saline, group II was injected with scopolamine (1 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks. After receiving a daily injection of scopolamine for 1 week, the mice of group III were injected with ranuncoside (10 mg/kg) every other day for 2 weeks along with scopolamine daily and group IV were injected with ranuncoside on 5th alternate days.

The phytochemical resveratrol has shown promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in AD, but it has low bioavailability. Chemical modification of resveratrol to its glycosylated form, polydatin (PD), significantly increases its bioavailability and bioactivity.<h4>Purpose</h4>The study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of PD against AD in rats.<h4>Material and method</h4>AD was caused by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of aluminum chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>). Six groups of six rats each were defined as sham, negative control (AlCl<sub>3</sub>), positive control (Donepezil), and treatments (PD 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, i.p.). On days 7, 8, 14, and 15, the rats' behavioral changes were assessed by the open field, Y-maze test, passive avoidance test, and elevated plus maze tests. At the end of the study, the blood samples were collected to assess the levels of glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and nitrite, as well as the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Furthermore, hippocampal brain tissue was removed and used for histological investigations.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>The findings revealed that PD injections at three different doses (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) improved cognitive and other behavioral impairments. Furthermore, PD improved the antioxidant capacity by increasing GSH and CAT while decreasing serum nitrite levels. PD showed anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the activity of inflammatory MMP-9, while elevating the activity of anti-inflammatory MMP-2. PD also modulated pathogenic changes in the hippocampal brain tissue.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PD alleviated cognitive and other behavioral impairments in AD rats by enhancing antioxidant defenses and reducing neuroinflammation."

Yet, unlike epilepsy, epileptiform activity is not always observed in AD, leading to skepticism. Historically, this absence has been attributed to limited recording depth or insufficient recording duration. We tested an alternative hypothesis that certain types of epileptiform activity, specifically high frequency oscillations (HFOs, defined as 250-500 Hz fast ripples), inhibit interictal spikes (IIS), which are currently used to assess hyperexcitability clinically. We recorded wideband (0.1-500 Hz) hippocampal local field potentials in three AD (Tg2576, Presenilin 2<sup>-/-</sup>, Ts65Dn Down syndrome model) and two epilepsy (intrahippocampal kainic acid, pilocarpine) mouse models during wakefulness and sleep. In both AD and epilepsy, HFOs consistently outnumbered IIS across behavioral states, age and recording contact. However, IIS and HFOs showed divergent relationships: a negative correlation between their rates was observed only in AD, in contrast to a positive correlation in epilepsy. HFOs preceded IIS at much shorter intervals in epilepsy than in AD. Co-occurrence of IIS with ripples did not differ between AD and epilepsy. These findings reveal a novel dissociation between clinically-relevant EEG biomarkers in AD and epilepsy. In AD, HFOs may inhibit IIS, which could lead to underestimation of hyperexcitability and hinder patient stratification for anti-seizure therapies. While non-invasive HFO detection remains challenging, we stress the need for wideband EEG/MEG, particularly in AD, to assess the full extent of hyperexcitability and biomarker interactions that would otherwise remain undetected."

Recent observations and advances in network medicine further indicate that AD likely shares common underlying mechanisms and intermediate pathophenotypes, or endophenotypes, with other diseases. In this review, we consider AD pathobiology, disease comorbidity, pleiotropy, and therapeutic development, and construct relevant endophenotype networks to guide future therapeutic development. Specifically, we discuss six main endophenotype hypotheses in AD: amyloidosis, tauopathy, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, vascular dysfunction, and lysosomal dysfunction. We further consider how this endophenotype network framework can provide advances in computational and experimental strategies for drug-repurposing and identification of new candidate therapeutic strategies for patients suffering from or at risk for AD. We highlight new opportunities for endophenotype-informed, drug discovery in AD, by exploiting multi-omics data. Integration of genomics, transcriptomics, radiomics, pharmacogenomics, and interactomics (protein-protein interactions) are essential for successful drug discovery. We describe experimental technologies for AD drug discovery including human induced pluripotent stem cells, transgenic mouse/rat models, and population-based retrospective case-control studies that may be integrated with multi-omics in a network medicine methodology.

We previously demonstrated behavioral and immunomodulatory effects of beta-adrenergic pharmacology in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current studies were designed to block noradrenergic signaling in 5XFAD mice through (1) chemogenetic inhibition of the locus coeruleus (LC), (2) pharmacologic blocking of β-adrenergic receptors, and (3) conditional deletion of β1- or β2-adrenergic receptors (adrb1 or adrb2) in microglia.First, brain-wide AD pathology was mapped in 3D by imaging immunolabeled, cleared 5XFAD brains to assess the overlap between amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology, reactive microglia, and the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the catecholaminergic system. To examine the effects of inhibiting the LC NE system in the 5XFAD model, inhibitory (Gi) DREADD receptors were expressed specifically in LC NE neurons. LC NE neurons were chronically inhibited through the subcutaneous pump administration of the DREADD agonist clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Plasma and brains were collected for assessment of neuroinflammation and pathology. A separate cohort of 5XFAD mice was chronically dosed with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol or vehicle and evaluated for behavior, as well as post-mortem neuroinflammation and pathology. Finally, we used 5XFAD mice with conditional deletion of either adrb1 or adrb2 in microglia to assess neuroinflammation and pathology mediated by β-adrenergic signaling.Using iDISCO+, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, and novel analyses, we detected widespread microgliosis and Aβ pathology, along with modest TH downregulation in fibers across multiple brain regions, in contrast to the spatially limited TH downregulation observed in neurons. Both chemogenetic inhibition of LC adrenergic signaling and pharmacological inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptors potentiated neuroinflammation without altering Aβ pathology. Conditional deletion of adrb1 in microglia did not affect neuroinflammation. Conditional deletion of adrb2 in microglia attenuated inflammation and pathology in females but had no effect in males. Overall, these data support previous observations demonstrating the immunomodulatory effects of beta-adrenergic signaling in the pathophysiology of brain disorders and suggest that adrenergic receptors on cell types other than microglia, such as astrocytes, may mediate some of the disease-modifying effects of β-adrenergic agonists in the brain."

Current drugs can only relieve symptoms, but cannot really cure AD. Cerebralcare Granule® (CG) is a Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) containing a variety of biologically active compounds. In our previous studies, CG has shown a beneficial effect against memory impairment in mice caused by D-galactose. However, whether CG can be used as a complementary medicine for the treatment of AD remains unexplored. Here, we use a combination of CG and memantine hydrochloride (Mm) to treat Alzheimer-like pathology and investigate the effects and mechanisms in vivo.<h4>Methods</h4>The histology of brain was examined with Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Golgi staining and Thioflavin S staining. ELISA was applied to assess the expression levels or activities of CAT, SOD, GSH-Px, MDA, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TBIL) in serum, as well as the levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the mice brain. Western blotting was used to assess the expression of β-secretase (BACE1), amyloid precursor protein (APP), APPβ, APPα, synaptophysin (SYN), growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95).<h4>Results</h4>In the present study, the combination group (CG + Mm) significantly attenuated Alzheimer-like behavior without adverse effects in APP/PS1 mice, indicating its high degree of safety and efficacy after long-term treatment. CG + Mm reduced AD pathological biomarker Aβ plaque accumulation by inhibiting BACE1 and APP expression (P < 0.05 or P < 0.001). Besides, the combination group markedly inhibited the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in hippocampus (P < 0.001), as well as activities of SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px in serum (P < 0.001). By contrast, the combination group improved synaptic plasticity by enhancing SYN, PSD95, and GAP43 expression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, these data supported the notion that CG combined with Mm might ameliorate the cognitive impairment through multiple pathways, suggesting that CG could play a role as complementary medicine to increase anti-AD effect of chemical drugs by reducing Aβ deposition, neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, and improving synaptic plasticity."

Unfortunately, the present existing drugs for AD only offer mild symptomatic cure and have more side effects. As such, developments of effective, nontoxic drugs are immediately required for AD therapy. Present study demonstrates a novel role of Chinese medicine prescription Yuan-Hu Zhi Tong (YZT) in treating AD, and it has substantiated the <i>in vivo</i> effectiveness of YZT in two different transgenic mice models of AD, namely P301S tau and 3XTg-AD mice. Oral treatment of YZT significantly ameliorates motor dysfunction as well as promotes the clearance of aggregated tau in P301S tau mice. YZT improves the cognitive function and reduces the insoluble tau aggregates in 3XTg-AD mice model. Furthermore, YZT decreases the insoluble AT8 positive neuron load in both P301S tau and 3XTg-AD mice. Using microarray and the ""Connectivity Map"" analysis, we determined the YZT-induced changes in expression of signaling molecules and revealed the potential mechanism of action of YZT. YZT might regulate ubiquitin proteasomal system for the degradation of tau aggregates. The research results show that YZT is a potential drug candidate for the therapy of tau pathogenesis and memory decline in AD."

Unfortunately, few medicines have succeeded to completely cure AD. Yangxue Qingnao (YXQN) is a Chinese traditional medicine, and its pharmacological effect is improving cerebral blood flow. In this study, we firstly demonstrated that YXQN reduced AD-like pathology and cognitive impairment in APPswePS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice with 2 months administration. Our data showed that YXQN substantially ameliorated behavioral defects in 10-month old APP/PS1 mice using Morris Water Maze and Y-maze tests, in which the cognitive ability of YXQN high-dose group approaches to wild type mice. Next, we focused on the brain pathological alterations in the YXQN group by three experiments, including thioflavin-S, congo-red, and Aβ-immunohistochemistry staining. The results demonstrated that the high-dose of YXQN dramatically suppressed amyloid plaques in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 mice, which showed a 47-72% reduction in plaque deposits, relative to the vehicle group. In addition, our data verified that YXQN decreased the cerebral amyloid load by attenuating β-secretase BACE1 and γ-secretase PS1 in the pathological processing of APP, and promoting the level of α-secretase ADAM10 in the physiological processing of APP to generate more sAPPα, which combats amyloidosis formation, and also carries out neurotropic and neuroprotective effect. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that YXQN could be a potential medicine for AD, and provide new evidence for further AD drug research and development."

Dual compounds targeting two pathways concurrently may enable enhanced effect. The study focuses on tacrine derivatives inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and simultaneously N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Compounds with balanced inhibitory potencies for the target proteins (K1578 and K1599) or increased potency for AChE (K1592 and K1594) were studied to identify the most promising pro-cognitive compound. Their effects were studied in cholinergic (scopolamine-induced) and glutamatergic (MK-801-induced) rat models of cognitive deficits in the Morris water maze. Moreover, the impacts on locomotion in the open field and AChE activity in relevant brain structures were investigated. The effect of the most promising compound on NMDA receptors was explored by in vitro electrophysiology. The cholinergic antagonist scopolamine induced a deficit in memory acquisition, however, it was unaffected by the compounds, and a deficit in reversal learning that was alleviated by K1578 and K1599. K1578 and K1599 significantly inhibited AChE in the striatum, potentially explaining the behavioral observations. The glutamatergic antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) induced a deficit in memory acquisition, which was alleviated by K1599. K1599 also mitigated the MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion in the open field. In vitro patch-clamp corroborated the K1599-associated NMDA receptor inhibitory effect. K1599 emerged as the most promising compound, demonstrating pro-cognitive efficacy in both models, consistent with intended dual effect. We conclude that tacrine has the potential for development of derivatives with dual in vivo effects. Our findings contributed to the elucidation of the structural and functional properties of tacrine derivatives associated with optimal in vivo pro-cognitive efficacy."

Therefore, the procognitive effects of acute systemic administration of H3R antagonist E169 (2.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) on MK801-induced amnesia in C57BL/6J mice using the novel object recognition test (NORT) were evaluated. E169 (5 mg) provided a significant memory-improving effect on MK801-induced short- and long-term memory impairments in NORT. The E169 (5 mg)-provided effects were comparable to those observed with the reference phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and were abrogated with the H3R agonist (<i>R</i>)-α-methylhistamine (RAMH). Additionally, our results demonstrate that E169 ameliorated MK801-induced memory deficits by antagonism of H3Rs and by modulation of the level of disturbance in the expression of PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3β proteins, signifying that E169 mitigated the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in the hippocampus of tested mice. Moreover, the results observed revealed that E169 (2.5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not alter anxiety levels and locomotor activity of animals in open field tests, demonstrating that performances improved following acute systemic administration with E169 in NORT are unrelated to changes in emotional response or in spontaneous locomotor activity. In summary, these obtained results suggest the potential of H3R antagonists such as E169, with good in silico physicochemical properties and stable retained key interactions in docking studies at H3R, in simultaneously modulating disturbed brain neurotransmitters and the imbalanced Akt-mTOR signaling pathway related to neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., AD."

Here, we investigated the influence of the acute and chronic administration of LY487379 or CDPPB (mGlu2 and mGlu5 PAMs), on eNOS expression in the mouse brain and the effect of the joint administration of the ligands with nitric oxide (NO) releasers, spermineNONOate or DETANONOate, in different combinations of doses, on MK-801- or scopolamine-induced amnesia in the novel object recognition (NOR) test.

However, conflicting data have been reported for these mice with regard to basal transmission as well as the in vitro correlate of memory, long-term potentiation (LTP). Some studies show clear impairments, whereas others report no deficiency. The present study uses hippocampal slices from 3-, 10-, and 15-month-old wild-type (WT) and Tg2576 mice to evaluate synaptic function in each group, including experiments to investigate basal synaptic transmission, short- and long-term plasticity by inducing paired-pulse facilitation, and both early and late LTP. We show that synaptic function remains intact in hippocampal slices from Tg2576 mice at 3 months of age. However, both early and late LTP decline progressively during aging in these mice. This deterioration of synaptic plasticity starts affecting early LTP, ultimately leading to the abolishment of both forms of LTP in 15-month-old animals. In comparison, WT littermates display normal synaptic parameters during aging. Additional pharmacological investigation into the involvement of NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels in LTP suggests a distinct mechanism of induction among age groups, demonstrating that both early and late LTP are differentially affected by these channels in Tg2576 mice during aging."

Five- and 10-mo-old wild-type mice and 5-mo-old 3xTg-AD showed significant cortical but not hippocampal dopamine increase during object exploration. On a 24-h ORM test, these three groups displayed significant ORM. In contrast, 10-mo-old 3xTg-AD mice showed impaired dopamine release in the insular cortex during ORM acquisition, as well as significant impairment in ORM. In addition, cortical administration of a dopamine reuptake blocker produced an increase of dopamine levels in the 10-mo-old 3xTg-AD mice and attenuated the memory impairment.

In addition, it preserved hippocampal cytoarchitecture, reduced neurodegeneration, and attenuated amyloid plaques and phosphorylated Tau deposition. Cellularly, BHB restored critical molecular mechanisms, including increased lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) hippocampal content as the main marker of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), along with the chaperon protein Hsp70. Moreover, BHB alleviated neuroinflammation by inhibiting the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation alongside the downstream targets cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1β/IL-18 cytokines. BHB also reduced pyroptotic markers, caspase-11 and gasdermin-N, and microglia-induced inflammation as it shifted microglial polarization toward the neuroprotective M2 phenotype. Finally, BHB normalized hippocampal neurotransmitter levels of the inhibited acetylcholine and serotonin. These findings support BHB as a promising, multifaceted treatment for AD, highlighting the roles of CMA, Hsp70, and 5-HT in slowing disease progression and improving cognitive function."

Both are considered AD hallmarks which are mediated through neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cholinergic circuit interruption. This study aimed to show how limettin and PD98059 exert a neuroprotective effect against SAD and the possible role of the extracellular regulated kinase (p-ERK1/2) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (p-GSK-3β) (Ser9)/cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB) (Ser133)/brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway. Control animals (Group I) received the vehicles, group II received PD98059 (10 mg/kg/i.p), while group III was administered limettin (15 mg/kg/i.p). Additionally, the other three groups received a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ; 3 mg/kg/ICV), where group IV served as the SAD group, while groups V and VI received PD98059 and limettin daily for 3 weeks, respectively. The SAD animals receiving PD98059 and limettin increased the number of arm entries, % alternations in Y-maze, with reduction in mean escape latency, increase in time spent in target quadrant and platform crossing in Morris Water Maze, compared to the SAD group. Additionally, PD98059 and limettin administration to the STZ group downregulated persistent activation of p-ERK1/2 which in turn increased p-GSK-3β (Ser9), leading to enhanced p-CREB (Ser133) and BDNF expressions, as well as reducing inflammatory markers viz., nuclear factor-kappa B and interleukin-6, leading to decreased Aβ deposition. Both treatments reduced immunohistochemical p-tau expression, brain edema, and increased intact neuron cells remarkably. Thus, based on these findings, PD98059 and limettin may have promising effects in protecting against SAD. Using blockers/inhibitory molecules are recommended to confirm effect through the corresponding pathway."

Streptozotocin (STZ) intracerebroventricularly (icv) treated rats are a well-accepted animal model for the sporadic Alzheimer`s disease (sAD). STZ-icv treatment results in an insulin-resistant brain state, cognitive deficits, and reduced hippocampal adult neurogenesis (AN). As the antidiabetic drug liraglutide (LIR) has been shown to improve AN, and spatial learning in an AD mouse model, we have investigated the effects of LIR treatment on spatial and fear-motivated learning, AN, and gene expression profiles in STZ-icv treated rats. Male Wistar rats were injected icv with STZ (f.c. 3 mg/kg) or vehicle. Two months later, four weeks of subcutaneous treatment with LIR (0.3 mg/kg) began. Cognitive abilities were assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) test. We performed quantitative immunohistochemistry to evaluate AN, and quantitative real-time PCR to determine the expression levels of genes involved in insulin signaling, glucose uptake, and neuroinflammation. STZ-icv rats showed significantly impaired spatial learning performance in the MWM and fear-motivated memory deficits in the PA test accompanied by reduced AN, downregulated insulin system- and glucose metabolism-related genes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. LIR treatment did not reverse these cognitive deficits of STZ-icv rats in the MWM, and did even worsen PA performance. However, LIR partially restored dysregulated gene expression, however, additionally stimulated neuroinflammation. Refined experimental designs, e.g., refined dosing, should help to further clarify the therapeutic potential of LIR in the future."

Clerodendrum infortunatum Linn. (Lamiaceae) is a shrub traditionally used as a medicinal plant to treat inflammation, skin diseases, and bronchitis. This study aims to identify the main bioactive metabolites in C. infortunatum using LC-QTOF-MS/MS and investigate its potential in protecting against cognitive decline in rats with scopolamine-induced AD disease. Metabolite profiling was performed on the methanol extract of the plant's aerial parts using LC-QTOF-MS/MS. The inhibitory activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme was measured in vitro. To evaluate the cognitive effects, the methanol extract was orally administered at three doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) to scopolamine-induced AD rats, and their cognitive functions were assessed using the novel object recognition test. Additionally, acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity, as well as the levels of acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, glutathione, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and amyloid-β in the rat hippocampus, were measured using ELISA, followed by histopathological evaluation. A total of 79 metabolites, spanning various chemical classes, such as organic acids, phenolic acids, phenylpropanoids and phenylethanoids, flavonoids, coumarins, other phenolics, and fatty acids and their derivatives, were identified. The results showed that the extract promoted enhanced cognitive functions in the novel object recognition test. Scopolamine administration significantly altered the acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity and biomarker levels in the rat's hippocampus. However, treatment with C. infortunatum at 200 and 400 mg/kg almost restored these neurotransmitter levels to normal, which was further confirmed by histopathological analysis. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of C. infortunatum in mitigating cognitive decline in AD, with its first metabolite profiling revealing a range of bioactive compounds. The extract improved cognitive function in scopolamine-induced AD rats, restored acetylcholinesterase activity, normalized neurotransmitter levels, and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings suggest that C. infortunatum is a promising candidate for the development of natural therapies targeting AD."

To address this limitation, we developed baicalin-myricetin (BM) functionalized selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs), termed BMSe@BSA, aimed at multi-targeted neuroprotection. <b>Materials and Methods</b>: BMSe@BSA nanoparticles were synthesized via a gel-sol technique using bovine serum albumin (BSA), ascorbic acid, selenous acid, and BM. Interactions among BSA, BM, and SeNPs were characterized by microscopy and spectrometry. Cytotoxicity was assessed on RAW 264.7 and PC12 cells to determine biocompatibility. Neuroinflammation and cognitive function were evaluated in C57BL6/J mice challenged with Aβ1-42. Recognition memory was tested through open-field exploration, novel object recognition (NOR), and T-maze assays. Inflammatory markers (IL-1β and TNF-α) and microglial changes in the cerebral cortex were quantified, while amyloid fibril morphology was assessed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). <b>Results</b>: Spectroscopic analysis verified successful BM functionalization. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a spherical morphology with an average particle size of 90.57 nm, zeta potential of 27.2 mV, and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.270.

In AD, the activation of microglia caused by Aβ accumulation is followed by the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and ultimately leads to cognitive impairments. Clausena harmandiana (CH) is a medicinal plant in the Rutaceae family and has been used in folk medicine to relieve illnesses such as stomachache and headache, and as a health tonic. Interestingly, CH root extract (CHRE) has several anti-inflammatory and other pharmacological activities, but there are no studies in AD-like animal models.<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aims to evaluate the effects of CHRE on cognitive impairments, increased Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> protein levels, and neuroinflammation in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced rats.<h4>Methods</h4>Forty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 8) of the sham control, V + Aβ, CB + Aβ CHRE125 + Aβ, CHRE250 + Aβ, and CHRE500 + Aβ. Sodium carboxymethylcellulose, Celebrex (10 mg/kg BW) and CHRE (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg BW) were given orally or without any treatment for 35 days. On day 21, aggregated Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> at a concentration of 1 μg/μl were injected into both lateral ventricles (1 μl/side) of all treated rats, while sterilized normal saline were injected to untreated rats. Ten days later, the novel object recognition test was performed to assess their recognition memory. At the end of the test period, an overdose of thiopental sodium (120 mg/kg BW) and transcardial perfusion with 0.9% normal saline solution were used to euthanize all rats. Then Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> protein levels and the expression of inflammatory markers (CD11b-positive microglia, IL-1β, and TNFα) were investigated in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.<h4>Results</h4>Pretreatment with CHRE at all doses could attenuate short- and long-term impairments in recognition memory. Additionally, CHRE also inhibited the increase of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> protein levels and the expression of inflammatory markers in both brain regions as well as receiving Celebrex.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This suggests that preventive treatment of CHRE might be a potential therapy against cognitive impairments via reducing Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> protein levels and neuroinflammation caused by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>."

Melatonin levels are decreased in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) patients, which suggests a relationship between the melatonergic system and sAD. Melatonin may reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, TAU protein hyperphosphorylation, and the formation of β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregates. Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the impact of treatment with 10 mg/kg of melatonin (i.p) in the animal model of <i>sAD</i> induced by the intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of 3 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ). ICV-STZ causes changes in the brain of rats similar to those found in patients with sAD. These changes include; progressive memory decline, the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, disturbances in glucose metabolism, insulin resistance and even reactive astrogliosis characterized by the upregulation of glucose levels and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The results show that ICV-STZ caused short-term spatial memory impairment in rats after 30 days of STZ infusion without locomotor impairment which was evaluated on day 27 post-injury. Furthermore, we observed that a prolonged 30-day treatment with melatonin can improve the cognitive impairment of animals in the Y-maze test, but not in the object location test. Finally, we demonstrated that animals receiving ICV-STZ have high levels of Aβ and GFAP in the hippocampus and that treatment with melatonin reduces Aβ levels but does not reduce GFAP levels, concluding that melatonin may be useful to control the progression of amyloid pathology in the brain."

Most studies, however, have been conducted with aerobic exercises, and few have investigated the effects of other modalities that also show positive effects on AD, such as resistance exercise (RE). In addition to its benefits in developing muscle strength, balance and muscular endurance favoring improvements in the quality of life of the elderly, RE reduces amyloid load and local inflammation, promotes memory and cognitive improvements, and protects the cortex and hippocampus from the degeneration that occurs in AD. Similar to AD patients, double-transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice exhibit Αβ plaques in the cortex and hippocampus, hyperlocomotion, memory deficits, and exacerbated inflammatory response. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 4 weeks of RE intermittent training on the prevention and recovery from these AD-related neuropathological conditions in APP/PS1 mice.<h4>Methods</h4>For this purpose, 6-7-month-old male APP/PS1 transgenic mice and their littermates, negative for the mutations (CTRL), were distributed into three groups: CTRL, APP/PS1, APP/PS1+RE. RE training lasted four weeks and, at the end of the program, the animals were tested in the open field test for locomotor activity and in the object recognition test for recognition memory evaluation. The brains were collected for immunohistochemical analysis of Aβ plaques and microglia, and blood was collected for plasma corticosterone by ELISA assay.<h4>Results</h4>APP/PS1 transgenic sedentary mice showed increased hippocampal Aβ plaques and higher plasma corticosterone levels, as well as hyperlocomotion and reduced central crossings in the open field test, compared to APP/PS1 exercised and control animals. The intermittent program of RE was able to recover the behavioral, corticosterone and Aβ alterations to the CTRL levels. In addition, the RE protocol increased the number of microglial cells in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Despite these alterations, no memory impairment was observed in APP/PS1 mice in the novel object recognition test.<h4>Discussion</h4>Altogether, the present results suggest that RE plays a role in alleviating AD symptoms, and highlight the beneficial effects of RE training as a complementary treatment for AD."

An FDA-approved anti-cancer drug, pazopanib, is reported to possess potent inhibitory effect against necroptosis via interfering with RIPK1. So far, there are no existing data on the influence of pazopanib on necroptotic pathway in AD. Thus, this study was designed to explore the impact of pazopanib on cognitive impairment provoked by ovariectomy (OVX) together with D-galactose (D-Gal) administration in rats and to scrutinize the putative signaling pathways underlying pazopanib-induced effects. Animals were allocated into four groups; the first and second groups were exposed to sham operation and administered normal saline and pazopanib (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.), respectively, for 6 weeks, while the third and fourth groups underwent OVX then were injected with D-Gal (150 mg/kg/day, i.p.); concomitantly with pazopanib in the fourth group for 6 weeks. Pazopanib ameliorated cognitive deficits as manifested by improved performance in the Morris water maze besides reversing the histological abnormalities. Pazopanib produced a significant decline in p-Tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques. The neuroprotective effect of pazopanib was revealed by hampering neuroinflammation, mitigating neuronal death and suppressing RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL necroptosis signaling pathway. Accordingly, hindering neuroinflammation and the necroptotic RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway could contribute to the neuroprotective effect of pazopanib in D-Gal/OVX rat model. Therefore, this study reveals pazopanib as a valuable therapeutic agent in AD that warrants future inspection to provide further data regarding its neuroprotective effect."

This study aimed to investigate the role of aripiprazole, a dopamine D2 and 5-HT1A selective receptors' activator, in the restoration of memory deficit induced by streptozotocin in mice. The cognitive functions of animals were determined using the Morris water maze. Brain sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Congo red to examine the structural deviations. Brain oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and glutathione), acetylcholinesterase activity, IL-6, and IL-10 were measured to assess biochemical alterations. Activation of D2 and 5-HT1A with aripiprazole attenuated STZ-induced cognitive deficit, increased brain GSH levels, reduced TBARS levels, AChE activity, IL-6 levels, and IL-10 levels and prevented STZ-induced brain anomalies in mice. Hence, the present study concluded that aripiprazole mitigated STZ-induced memory impairment and can be used as an efficacious therapeutic target for the management of AD."

One isoform of ChAT, 82-kDa ChAT, is expressed only in primates and found primarily in nuclei of cholinergic neurons in younger individuals, but this protein becomes mostly cytoplasmic with increasing age and in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies suggest that 82-kDa ChAT may be involved in regulating gene expression during cellular stress. Since it is not expressed in rodents, we developed a transgenic mouse model that expresses human 82-kDa ChAT under the control of an Nkx2.1 driver. Behavioral and biochemical assays were used to phenotype this novel transgenic model and elucidate the impact of 82-kDa ChAT expression. The 82-kDa ChAT transcript and protein were expressed predominantly in basal forebrain neurons and subcellular distribution of the protein recapitulated the age-related pattern found previously in human necropsy brains. Older 82-kDa ChAT-expressing mice presented with better age-related memory and inflammatory profiles. In summary, we established a novel transgenic mouse expressing 82-kDa ChAT that is valuable for studying the role of this primate-specific cholinergic enzyme in pathologies associated with cholinergic neuron vulnerability and dysfunction."

An AD-like rat model was induced by aluminum chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>; 50 mg/kg/day for six consecutive weeks; i.p), whereas a methanolic standardized P. harmala seed extract (187.5 mg/kg; p.o) was given to AD rats starting 2 weeks post AlCl<sub>3</sub> exposure. Two additional groups of rats were administered either the vehicle to serve as the normal control or the vehicle + P. harmala seed extract to serve as the P. harmala control group. P. harmala enhanced cognition appraised by Y-maze and Morris water maze tests and improved histopathological structures altered by AlCl<sub>3</sub>. Additionally, it heightened the hippocampal contents of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and insulin, but abated insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation at serine 307 (pS307-IRS-1). Besides, P. harmala increased phosphorylated Akt at serine 473 (pS473-Akt) and glucose transporter type (GLUT)4. The extract also curtailed the hippocampal content of beta amyloid (Aβ)42, glycogen synthase (GSK)-3β and phosphorylated tau. It also enhanced Nrf2, while reduced lipid peroxides and replenished glutathione. In conclusion, combating insulin resistance by P. harmala is a novel machinery in attenuating the insidious progression of AD by enhancing both insulin and GLP-1 trajectories in the hippocampus favoring GLUT4 production."

Elevated BACE1 levels in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients implicate that dysregulated BACE1 expression is crucial to AD pathogenesis. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identified that the G protein subunit β5 gene (Gnb5), a component of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, is significantly downregulated in both human AD patients and AD mouse models. Conditional knockout of Gnb5 in excitatory neurons resulted in cognitive impairments, whereas adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of Gnb5 in the hippocampus ameliorated cognitive deficits and reduced Aβ deposition in 5xFAD mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Gnb5 interacts with BACE1, modulating its expression and potentially influencing Aβ generation. We further identify the first tryptophan-aspartate domain (WD domain) of Gnb5 and the Ser81 residue as crucial for this regulation. Expression of this WD domain alone is sufficient to reduce Aβ deposition in 5xFAD mice, whereas a point mutation at Ser81 (S81L) abolishes this effect. Overall, our findings establish Gnb5 as a negative regulator of the BACE1-APP processing axis and unveil mechanistic insights into its role in Aβ-mediated AD pathogenesis."

We found that Onjisaponin B of RAPO functioned as RAPO to suppress Aβ production without direct inhibition of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase activities. Our mechanistic study showed that Onjisaponin B promoted the degradation of amyloid precursor protein (APP).

The performance of 3xTg-AD mice was significantly improved with ibuprofen treatment compared to untreated 3xTg-AD mice. Ibuprofen-treated transgenic mice showed a significant decrease in intraneuronal oligomeric Abeta and hyperphosphorylated tau (AT8) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus.

Our findings show that prophylactic treatment of young 3xTg-AD mice with ibuprofen reduces intraneuronal oligomeric Abeta, reduces cognitive deficits, and prevents hyperphosphorylated tau immunoreactivity. These findings provide further support for intraneuronal Abeta as a cause of cognitive impairment, and suggest that pathological alterations of tau are associated with intraneuronal oligomeric Abeta accumulation."

Although highly effective, this method occasionally can cause esophageal injury as well as restraint-associated distress, particularly with repeated use. The aim of this study was to assess an alternative oral dosing method that could reduce the distress and morbidity associated with standard gavage techniques. The palatability and pharmacokinetic profile of 2 medicines approved for the treatment of Alzheimer disease, donepezil and galantamine, were investigated in male Lister hooded rats by using a syringe-feeding method and compared with results from traditional gavage administration. In addition, the stimulant nicotine was tested by using the syringe-feeding method in a separate series of experiments. Animals reliably learned to drink voluntarily from the syringe, and latency to drink decreased rapidly. The addition of donepezil, galantamine, or nicotine to sucrose had no apparent effect on the palatability of the solution, although nicotine produced aversive effects that inhibited subsequent voluntary intake. Oral bioavailability was improved by using syringe feeding with donepezil but not galantamine. Both drugs improved cognitive performance in the novel object recognition test, with similar behavioral profiles between the 2 methods of administration. Our results suggest that the syringe-feeding technique is an effective alternative oral dosing method in rats."

As the removal of amyloid burden from AD patient brains by antibodies has shown therapeutic potential, the development of small molecule drugs inducing chemical dissociation and clearance of Aβ is compelling as a therapeutic strategy. In this study, we synthesized and screened aryloxypropanolamine derivatives and identified 1-(3-(2,4-di-tert-pentylphenoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl)pyrrolidin-1-ium chloride, YIAD002, as a strong dissociator of Aβ aggregates.<h4>Methods</h4>The dissociative activity of aryloxypropanolamine derivatives against Aβ aggregates were evaluated through in vitro assays. Immunohistochemical staining, immunoblot assays, and the Morris water maze were used to assess the anti-Alzheimer potential in YIAD002-treated 5XFAD and transgenic APP/PS1 mice. Target-ligand interaction mechanism was characterized via a combination of peptide mapping, fluorescence dissociation assays, and constrained docking simulations.<h4>Results</h4>Among 11 aryloxypropanolamine derivatives, YIAD002 exerted strongest dissociative activity against β-sheet-rich Aβ aggregates. Upon oral administration, YIAD002 substantially reduced amyloid burden and accordingly, improved cognitive performance in the Morris water maze and attenuated major pathological hallmarks of AD including tauopathy, neuroinflammation, and synaptic protein loss. Mechanism studies suggest that YIAD002 interferes with intermolecular β-sheet fibrillation by directly interacting with KLVFFA and IGLMVG domains of Aβ. In addition, YIAD002 was found to possess dissociative activity against aggregates of pyroglutamate-modified Aβ and tau.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Collectively, our results evince the potential of chemical-driven dissociation of Aβ aggregates by aryloxypropanolamines as a therapeutic modality of the amyloid clearance approach."

Identification of new drug targets is needed. Neuroinflammation is a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders, and TNF-α a pivotal neuroinflammatory driver.<h4>New hypothesis</h4>AD-associated chronic neuroinflammation directly drives progressive synaptic/neuronal loss and cognitive decline. Pharmacologically mitigating microglial/astrocyte activation without altering Aβ generation will define the role of neuroinflammation in AD progression.<h4>Major challenges</h4>Difficulty of TNF-α-lowering compounds reaching brain, and identification of a therapeutic-time window to preserve the beneficial role of neuroinflammatory processes.<h4>Linkage to other major theories</h4>Microglia/astroglia are heavily implicated in maintenance of synaptic plasticity/function in healthy brain and are disrupted by Aβ. Mitigation of chronic gliosis can restore synaptic homeostasis/cognitive function."

This study aims to examine the AD spreading role of EVs through the exposure of isolated EVs from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD to wild type mice.<h4>Methods</h4>CSF EVs from subjects with AD dementia were administered to C57BL/6 mice for 3 months. The Morris water maze (MWM) and Novel object recognition (NOR) tests were selected to evaluate the spatial memory deficits. Neuroinflammation and synaptic integrity were evaluated with GFAP/Iba1 and synaptophysin immunohistochemistry assays. Aβ plaques were analyzed using Thioflavin-S (ThS) staining. Proteomic profiles of human CSF EVs and mice plasma were analyzed by using CNS NULISAseq™ (Alamar BioSciences).<h4>Results</h4>Animals exposed to AD CSF EVs showed significant memory deficits in both MWM (p = 0.0207) and NOR (p = 0.0394) tests compared to their control littermates. Immunohistochemical analysis showed significant differences in the neuroinflammation and synaptic pattern in AD EVs-exposed animals. ThS staining detected no Aβ plaques in either group. However, proteomic analysis revealed significant differences in the soluble fractions in both human CSF EVs and mice plasma between AD dementia and control groups.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Preliminary results suggest that EVs may play a key role in the dissemination of AD pathology. Long-exposure of AD CSF EVs to healthy mice appears to affect their cognitive function, learning and memory ability and promotes neuroinflammation and synaptic impairment. Further experiments are still needed for a better understanding of these effects."

We identified the six tau isoforms that are produced in the adult human brain from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing and showed that they are present in PHFs. The relevance of tau became clearer in 1998, when three papers showed that tau gene mutations cause 'frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17' (FTDP-17). Sixty-five different mutations have now been identified and filamentous tau inclusions are always present. This work has made it possible to produce transgenic mouse lines that form filamentous tau inclusions and exhibit neurodegeneration. We produced such a line that also led us to demonstrate that filamentous tau exhibits prion-like properties in the brain.<h4>Method</h4>Since 2017 we are determining the near-atomic structures of tau filaments from human brains by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM).<h4>Result</h4>The different Alzheimer and Pick tau folds establish the existence of molecular conformers of assembled tau. Even though tau filaments from the brains of individuals with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are also made of all six brain tau isoforms, the CTE fold is distinct from the Alzheimer fold.

Multifunctional Molecules (MFMs) specifically designed to address other contributing factors, such as metal ion induced abnormalities, oxidative stress, toxic Aβ aggregates etc. are very much required. Several multifunctional molecules have been developed using different molecular scaffolds. Reported herein is a new series of four MFMs based on ThT, Azo-stilbene and metal ion chelating pockets. The synthesis, characterization, and metal chelation ability for [Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>] are presented herein. Furthermore, we explored their multifunctionality w.r.t. to their (i) recognition of Aβ aggregates and monomeric form, (ii) utility in modulating the aggregation pathways of both metal-free and metal-bound amyloid-β, (iii) ex-vivo staining of amyloid plaques in 5xFAD mice brain sections, (iv) ability to scavenge free radicals and (v) ability to inhibit cholinesterase activity. Molecular docking studies were also performed with Aβ peptides and acetylcholinesterase enzyme to understand the observed inhibitory effect on activity. Overall, the studies presented here establish the multifunctional nature of these molecules and qualify them as promising candidates for furthermore investigation in the quest for finding Alzheimer's disease treatment."

Although methylthioninium (MT) treatment was found to be beneficial in tau transgenic models, the brain concentrations required to inhibit tau aggregation in vivo are unknown. The comparative efficacy of methylthioninium chloride (MTC) and leucomethylthioninium salts (LMTX; 5-75 mg/kg; oral administration for 3-8 weeks) was assessed in two novel transgenic tau mouse lines. Behavioural (spatial water maze, RotaRod motor performance) and histopathological (tau load per brain region) proxies were applied. Both MTC and LMTX dose-dependently rescued the learning impairment and restored behavioural flexibility in a spatial problem-solving water maze task in Line 1 (minimum effective dose: 35 mg MT/kg for MTC, 9 mg MT/kg for LMTX) and corrected motor learning in Line 66 (effective doses: 4 mg MT/kg). Simultaneously, both drugs reduced the number of tau-reactive neurons, particularly in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in Line 1 and in a more widespread manner in Line 66. MT levels in the brain followed a sigmoidal concentration-response relationship over a 10-fold range (0.13-1.38 μmol/l). These data establish that diaminophenothiazine compounds, like MT, can reverse both spatial and motor learning deficits and reduce the underlying tau pathology, and therefore offer the potential for treatment of tauopathies."

The impairment of processes responsible for adequate brain energy supply primarily determines the early features of the aging process. Restricting brain energy supply results in brain hypometabolism prior to clinical symptoms and is anatomically and functionally associated with cognitive impairment. The present study investigated changes in metabolic profiles induced by intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) in an AD-like animal model. To this end, male Wistar rats received a single injection of STZ (3 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>) by ICV (2.5 μL into each ventricle for 5 min on each side). In the second week after receiving ICV-STZ, rats were tested for cognitive performance using the Morris Water Maze test and subsequently prepared for positron emission tomography (PET) to confirm AD-like symptoms. Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis was used to detect amino acid changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CFS) samples. Our metabolomics study revealed a reduction in the concentrations of various amino acids (alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophane, tyrosine, and valine) in CSF of ICV-STZ-treated animals as compared to controls rats. The results of the current study indicate amino acid levels could potentially be considered targets of nutritional and/or pharmacological interventions to interfere with AD progression."

Corinthian currants and their components have been shown to display antioxidant and other neuroprotective effects in AD. We evaluated the effect of a Corinthian currant paste-supplemented diet (CurD), provided to 1-month-old 5xFAD mice for 1, 3, and 6 months, on PON1 activity and levels of oxidation markers in serum and the brain of mice as compared to a control diet (ConD) or glucose/fructose-matched diet (GFD). Administration of CurD for 1 month increased PON1 activity and decreased oxidized lipid levels in serum compared to ConD and GFD. Longer-term administration of CurD did not, however, affect serum PON1 activity and oxidized lipid levels. Furthermore, CurD administered for 1 and 3 months, but not for 6 months, increased PON1 activity and decreased free radical levels in the cortex of mice compared to ConD and GFD. To probe the mechanism for the increased PON1 activity in mice, we studied the effect of Corinthian currant polar phenolic extract on PON1 activity secreted by Huh-7 hepatocytes or HEK293 cells transfected with a PON1-expressing plasmid. Incubation of cells with the extract led to a dose-dependent increase of secreted PON1 activity, which was attributed to increased cellular PON1 expression. Collectively, our findings suggest that phenolics in Corinthian currants can increase the hepatic expression and activity of antioxidant enzyme PON1 and that a Corinthian currant-supplemented diet during the early stages of AD in mice reduces brain oxidative stress."

In this study, we found that the circulating TMAO levels displayed an age-related increase in both WT and APP/PS1 mice and association with AD-like behavioral and pathological profile. Reduced TMAO by 3,3-Dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB) treatment ameliorated the cognitive deterioration and long-term potentiation (LTP) in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, DMB treatment also induced a decrease in the Amyloid-β (Aβ)<sub>1-42</sub>, β-secretase, and β-secretase-cleaved C-terminal fragment (βCTF) levels in the hippocampus. Finally, the effects obtained after treatment with DMB were accompanied by a reduction in circulating clusterin levels and hippocampal neuroinflammatory status in APP/PS1 mice. These findings demonstrate that elevated circulating TMAO during the aging process might deteriorate cognitive function and pathology in APP/PS1 mice."

Its causes are not fully understood, but it is now known that factors like mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and compromised ion channels contribute to its onset and progression. Flickering light therapy has shown promise in AD treatment, though its mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD to evaluate the effects of 40 Hz flickering light therapy. Rats received intracerebroventricular (ICV) STZ injections, and 7 days after, they were exposed to 40 Hz flickering light for 15 min daily over seven days. Cognitive and memory functions were assessed using Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and passive avoidance tests. STZ-induced AD rats exhibited cognitive decline, elevated reactive oxygen species, amyloid beta accumulation, decreased serotonin and dopamine levels, and impaired mitochondrial function. However, light therapy prevented these effects, preserving cognitive function and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, flickering light restored mitochondrial metabolites and normalized ATP-insensitive mitochondrial calcium-sensitive potassium (mitoBKCa) channel activity, which was otherwise downregulated in AD rats. Our findings suggest that 40 Hz flickering light therapy could be a promising treatment for neurodegenerative disorders like AD by preserving synaptic and mitochondrial function."

One of the earliest reported signs of Alzheimer's disease is olfactory dysfunction, which may manifest in a variety of ways. The present study sought to address this issue by investigating odor coding in the anterior piriform cortex, the primary cortical region involved in higher order olfactory function, and how it relates to performance on olfactory behavioral tasks. An olfactory habituation task was performed on cohorts of transgenic and age-matched wild-type mice at 3, 6 and 12 months of age. These animals were then anesthetized and acute, single-unit electrophysiology was performed in the anterior piriform cortex. In addition, in a separate group of animals, a longitudinal odor discrimination task was conducted from 3-12 months of age. Results showed that while odor habituation was impaired at all ages, Tg2576 performed comparably to age-matched wild-type mice on the olfactory discrimination task. The behavioral data mirrored intact anterior piriform cortex single-unit odor responses and receptive fields in Tg2576, which were comparable to wild-type at all age groups. The present results suggest that odor processing in the olfactory cortex and basic odor discrimination is especially robust in the face of amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) over-expression and advancing amyloid β (Aβ) pathology. Odor identification deficits known to emerge early in Alzheimer's disease progression, therefore, may reflect impairments in linking the odor percept to associated labels in cortical regions upstream of the primary olfactory pathway, rather than in the basic odor processing itself."

In our study, astrocytes treated with amyloid β1-42 (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>) to simulate AD conditions exhibited upregulated expressions of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific protease 1 (SENP1) and Pumilio RNA Binding Family Member 2 (PUM2), alongside decreased levels of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). SENP1 is notably the most upregulated SUMOylation enzyme in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-exposed astrocytes. Functional assays including Ni<sup>2+</sup>-Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) agarose bead pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) confirmed SENP1's role in actively deSUMOylating PUM2, thereby enhancing its stability and expression. The interaction between PUM2 and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of NRF2 mRNA reduces NRF2 levels, subsequently diminishing the transcriptional activation of critical glycolytic enzymes, Hexokinase 1 (HK1) and Glucose Transporter 1 (GLUT1). These changes contribute to the observed reduction in glycolytic function in astrocytes, exacerbating neuronal apoptosis. Targeted interventions, such as knockdown of Senp1 or Pum2 or overexpression of NRF2 in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice, effectively increased HK1 and GLUT1 levels, decreased apoptosis, and alleviated cognitive impairment. These findings highlight the important roles of the SENP1/PUM2/NRF2 pathway in influencing glucose metabolism in astrocytes, presenting new potential therapeutic targets for AD."

Variants which alter PLCG2 activity impact Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but the effects of PLCG2 deficiency in AD remain unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>5xFAD mice were crossed with PLCG2- and TREM2-deficient mice to assess the role of PLCG2 in response to amyloid pathology. Human bulk RNA-sequencing data were used to validate findings in AD patients.<h4>Results</h4>In 5xFAD mice, the absence of PLCG2 resulted in reduced TREM2 expression and impaired microglial associations with amyloid beta plaques. Transcriptomic analysis revealed perturbations in immune-related pathways shared between PLCG2 and TREM2 deficiencies, as well as distinct differences. Human transcriptomics revealed positive correlations between PLCG2 and TREM2 independent of pathological scores.<h4>Discussion</h4>PLCG2 is a critical component of TREM2 signal transduction and may play an upstream role in TREM2 regulation. These findings clarify the mechanisms of risk and protective PLCG2 variants.<h4>Highlights</h4>The role of phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2) deficiency in response to amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology was investigated in 5xFAD mice and with human cortical transcriptomics. PLCG2 deficiency significantly reduces triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) expression, while TREM2 deficiency increases PLCG2 expression. PLCG2 expression predicts TREM2 expression in human cortex independent of pathology. PLCG2 and TREM2 deficiencies similarly impair microglial responses to Aβ plaques, exacerbate neuronal pathology, and impair gene expression associated with immune responses. PLCG2 deficiency confers distinct transcriptional perturbations from TREM2 deficiency. PLCG2 may play an upstream role in the regulation of the TREM2-mediated immune response."

Retinal pathology and the regulation of serine racemase (SR) were investigated in the retinas of APP(SW)/PS1(∆E9) mice.<h4>Methods</h4>SR in the retinas and the content of D-serine in the aqueous humor were analyzed. The structure and function of the retina were assessed. Additionally, the regulation of SR in primary Müller cell cultures was investigated.<h4>Results</h4>SR levels were significantly higher in the retinas of 18- and 24-month-old male APP/PS1 mice, whereas aqueous humor D-serine was lower in 24-month-old APP/PS1 male mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Neither Aβ nor 17β-estradiol increased SR, but the combination of both did in Müller cell cultures. In contrast, 17β-estradiol increased Srr mRNA in the cultures. At 8 months of age, male APP/PS1 mice began to display reduced b-wave amplitude in scotopic and photopic electroretinography (ERG) recordings, unlike female APP/PS1 mice. Although the retinal layer thickness in APP/PS1 mice did not differ from WT mice, there was overt apoptosis in the inner and outer nuclear layers of the APP/PS1 mice retinas.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The age- and sex-specific regulation of SR is correlated with the pathology of an AD retina. Because the time window for SR regulation and D-serine alteration occurs after photoreceptor dysfunction in the AD retinas, it has limited value as a detection biomarker but may be useful as a topographic biomarker for staging severity and monitoring drug interventions in the eye or central nervous system."

The autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that resides on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is involved in various essential biological processes. However, the role of AMFR in AD is still unidentified.<h4>Methods</h4>Behavioral experiments, including open-field test (OFT), novel object recognition test (NORT) and morris water maze test (MWMT) were conducted after adeno-associated virus (AAV) microinjection into AD model mice. Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), qPCR and ubiquitination assay were used to analyze AMFR mediated ubiquitination degradation of amyloid precursor protein (APP). ELISA was employed to evaluate changes in amyloidogenic cleavage products of APP following upregulation or downregulation of AMFR in neural cells and analyze AMFR levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AD patients.<h4>Results</h4>The progressive decline in AMFR levels was found not only in the hippocampus of APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice but also in the CSF and serum of patients with AD. Moreover, the interaction of AMFR and APP was observed both in hippocampal tissues and brain neurons. In addition, AMFR promoted the K11-linked polyubiquitination of APP to speed up its proteasomal degradation, resulting in decreased Aβ production. Importantly, AMFR overexpression largely rescued the cognitive and synaptic deficits in APP/PS1 mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, our results demonstrated that AMFR reduced Aβ production and alleviated cognitive impairment by promoting the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of APP. This study indicated that AMFR could have the potential to be a therapeutic target of early-stage AD."

In addition, the use of high drug concentrations to overcome this challenge may entail side effects. To address these challenges and enhance the precision of delivery into brain regions affected by amyloid aggregation, we proposed a transferrin-conjugated nanoparticle-based drug delivery system. The transferrin-conjugated melittin-loaded L-arginine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Tf-MeLioNs) developed in this study successfully mitigated melittin-induced cytotoxicity and hemolysis in the cell culture system. In the 5XFAD mouse brain, Tf-MeLioNs remarkably reduced amyloid plaque accumulation, particularly in the hippocampus. This study suggested Tf-LioNs as a potential drug delivery platform and Tf-MeLioNs as a candidate for therapeutic drug targeting of amyloid plaques in AD. These findings provide a foundation for further exploration and advancement in AD therapeutics."

Serum biomarkers, behavioral tests, cerebral neurotransmitters, and differentially gene expression were evaluated in standard and malnourished diet-fed transgenic APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice.<h4>Results</h4>Poor nutritional status and increased cerebral blood flow in the midbrain and striatum were associated with severe general NPSs and subtypes, especially depression, anxiety, and apathy. APP/PS1 mice fed a malnourished diet showed poor nutritional status, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, altered neurotransmitter levels, and downregulated c-Fos expression in the midbrain and striatum; these were associated with suppressed cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway.<h4>Discussion</h4>Malnutrition exacerbating NPSs is relevant to suppressed cAMP pathway in the midbrain and striatum, suggesting the potential for targeted nutritional interventions to mitigate NPSs in the AD continuum.<h4>Highlights</h4>Poor nutritional status linked to general and specific neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) deterioration. Malnutrition affects NPSs, usually involving the midbrain and striatum. Malnourished diet induces depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in APP/PS1 mice. Malnutrition exacerbates NPSs associated with cAMP signaling pathway in the midbrain and striatum."

In transgenic models selectively expressing amyloid-β (Aβ), thioflavin S (ThS), a fluorescent dye with β-sheet binding properties, is widely employed to observe amyloid plaque accumulation. In this study, we investigated the possibility that a commonly used Aβ-expressing AD model mouse, 5XFAD, generates ThS-positive aggregates of β-sheet structures in addition to Aβ fibrils. To test this hypothesis, brain sections of male and female 5XFAD mice were double-stained with ThS and monoclonal antibodies against Aβ, tau, or α-synuclein, all of which aggregates are detected by ThS. Our results revealed that, in addition to amyloid plaques, 5XFAD mice express ThS-positive phospho-tau (p-tau) aggregates. Upon administration of a small molecule that exclusively disaggregates Aβ to 5XFAD mice for six weeks, we found that the reduction level of plaques was smaller in brain sections stained by ThS compared to an anti-Aβ antibody. Our findings implicate that the use of ThS complicates the quantification of amyloid plaques and the assessment of Aβ-targeting drugs in 5XFAD mice."

Here, we investigated the role of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in AD using the amyloid + tau-driven 3xTg-AD mouse model. We found deficits in reward-based operant learning in AD mice, suggesting possible VTA DA neuron dysregulation. Physiological assessment revealed hyperexcitability and disrupted firing in DA neurons caused by reduced activity of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels. RNA sequencing from contents of single patch-clamped DA neurons (Patch-seq) identified up-regulation of the SK channel modulator casein kinase 2 (CK2), which we corroborated by immunohistochemical protein analysis. Pharmacological inhibition of CK2 restored SK channel activity and normal firing patterns in 3xTg-AD mice. These findings identify a mechanism of ion channel dysregulation in VTA DA neurons that could contribute to behavioral abnormalities in AD, paving the way for novel treatment strategies."

Clinically, the development of AD and obesity are known to be correlated. In this study, we analyzed the changes in AD pathological characteristics in 5XFAD mice after obesity induction through a high-fat diet (HFD). Surprisingly, high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein AI (APOA-I) serum levels were increased without low-density lipoprotein alteration in both HFD groups. The reactivity of astrocytes and microglia in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and fornix of the hypothalamus in 5XFAD mice was decreased in the transgenic (TG)-HFD high group. Finally, the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus was also significantly decreased in the TG-HFD high group. These results suggest that increased high-density lipoprotein level, especially with increased APOA-I serum level, alleviates the pathological features of AD and could be a new potential therapeutic strategy for AD treatment."

Increased amyloid plaque deposition within cerebral blood vessels, specifically the smooth muscle layer, is linked to increased cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and impaired cognition in CAA. Studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown that amyloid plaque pathology is more prevalent in the brains of elderly women (2/3rd of the dementia population) compared with men, however, there is a paucity of studies on sex differences in CAA<i>.</i> The objective of this study was to discern the sexual dichotomies in CAA<i>.</i> We utilized male and female Tg-SwDI mice (mouse model of CAA) at 12-14 months of age for this study. We evaluated sex differences in CMBs, cognitive function and inflammation. Cognition was assessed using Y-maze (spatial working memory) and Fear Conditioning (contextual memory). CMBs were quantified by <i>ex vivo</i> brain MRI scans. Inflammatory cytokines in brain were quantified using ELISA. Our results demonstrated that aging Tg-SwDI female mice had a significantly higher burden of CMBs on MRI as compared to males. Interestingly, these aging Tg-SwDI female mice also had significantly impaired spatial and contextual memory on Y maze and Fear Conditioning respectively. Furthermore, female mice had significantly lower circulating inflammatory cytokines, IL-1α, IL-2, IL-9, and IFN-γ, as compared to males. Our results demonstrate that aging female Tg-SwDI mice are more cognitively impaired and have higher number of CMBs, as compared to males at 12-14 months of age. This may be secondary to reduced levels of neural repair cytokines (IL-1α, IL-2, IL-9 and IFN-γ) involved in sex specific inflammatory signaling in CAA."
"2,2,2-tribromoethanol",TREM2 splice isoforms generate soluble TREM2 species that disrupt long-term potentiation.,36805764,10.1186/s13073-023-01160-z,,2023,animal,negative,0,1,amyloid;tau;microglia;synapse,"<h4>Background</h4>TREM2 is a transmembrane receptor expressed by myeloid cells and acts to regulate their immune response. TREM2 governs the response of microglia to amyloid and tau pathologies in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. TREM2 is also present in a soluble form (sTREM2), and its CSF levels fluctuate as a function of AD progression. Analysis of stroke and AD mouse models revealed that sTREM2 proteins bind to neurons, which suggests sTREM2 may act in a non-cell autonomous manner to influence neuronal function. sTREM2 arises from the proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-associated receptor. However, alternatively spliced TREM2 species lacking a transmembrane domain have been postulated to contribute to the pool of sTREM2. Thus, both the source of sTREM2 species and its actions in the brain remain unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>The expression of TREM2 isoforms in the AD brain was assessed through the analysis of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer's Disease Consortium transcriptomics data, as well as qPCR analysis using post-mortem samples of AD patients and of the AD mouse model 5xFAD. TREM2 cleavage and secretion were studied in vitro using HEK-293T and HMC3 cell lines. Synaptic plasticity, as evaluated by induction of LTP in hippocampal brain slices, was employed as a measure of sTREM2 actions.<h4>Results</h4>Three distinct TREM2 transcripts, namely ENST00000373113 (TREM2<sup>230</sup>), which encodes the full-length transmembrane receptor, and the alternatively spliced isoforms ENST00000373122 (TREM2<sup>222</sup>) and ENST00000338469 (TREM2<sup>219</sup>), are moderately increased in specific brain regions of patients with AD. We provide experimental evidence that TREM2 alternatively spliced isoforms are translated and secreted as sTREM2. Furthermore, our functional analysis reveals that all sTREM2 species inhibit LTP induction, and this effect is abolished by the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin.<h4>Conclusions</h4>TREM2 transcripts can give rise to a heterogeneous pool of sTREM2 which acts to inhibit LTP. These results provide novel insight into the generation, regulation, and function of sTREM2 which fits into the complex biology of TREM2 and its role in human health and disease. Given that sTREM2 levels are linked to AD pathogenesis and progression, our finding that sTREM2 species interfere with LTP furthers our understanding about the role of TREM2 in AD."

Repetitive mild TBI (r-mTBI) is directly associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by focal perivascular to widespread Alzheimer-type neurofibrillary pathology of hyperphosphorylated tau. Studies in animal models have shown hyperphosphorylation of tau after TBI. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TBI leads to tau pathology are not understood. In this study, we employed western blots and immunohistochemistry to test, in triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD), the effect of r-mTBI on tau hyperphosphorylation and activation of asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP), a cysteine proteinase which is known to be involved in tau hyperphosphorylation. We found that the level of active AEP was increased and correlated with the level of tau hyperphosphorylation following r-mTBI, and that fimbria showed increased immunoreactivity to phospho-tau. In addition, inhibitor 2 of protein phosphatase 2A (I2PP2A) was translocated from neuronal nucleus to the cytoplasm and colocalized with hyperphosphorylated tau. These data suggest the involvement of AEP-I2PP2A-PP2A-ptau pathway in tau pathology in TBI."

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) is a powerful label-free technique that has been extensively utilized for the interrogation of spatial changes of various metabolites in neurodegenerative disease. However, technical limitations still exist in MALDI MS, and there is a need to improve the performance of traditional MALDI for a deeper investigation of metabolic alterations in the AD mouse model. In this work, 4-aminocinnoline-3-carboxamide (4-AC) was developed into a novel dual-polarity MALDI matrix. Compared with traditionally used MALDI matrices such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and 9-aminoacridine (9-AA), 4-AC exhibited superior performance in UV absorption at 355 nm, ion yields, background interference, and vacuum stability, making it an ideal MALDI matrix for comprehensive evaluation of metabolic alteration in the brain and serum of APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD. In total, 93 metabolites exhibited different levels of regional changes in the brain of AD mice as compared to the age-matched controls. Moreover, in the serum of AD mice, 81 altered metabolites distinguishing the AD group from the control were observed by using multivariate statistical analysis. It is expected that the application of the MALDI MSI method developed in this work to visualize the spatio-chemical change of various metabolites may improve our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of AD."

Although the primary Aβ produced physiologically is Aβ1-40/42, an explanation for how and why this physiological Aβ is converted to the pathological form remains elusive. Here, we present experimental evidence that accounts for the aging-associated Aβ3pE-42 deposition: Aβ3pE-42 was metabolically more stable than other Aβx-42 variants; deficiency of neprilysin, the major Aβ-degrading enzyme, induced a relatively selective deposition of Aβ3pE-42 in both APP transgenic and <i>App</i> knock-in mouse brains; Aβ3pE-42 deposition always colocalized with Pittsburgh compound B-positive cored plaques in APP transgenic mouse brains; and under aberrant conditions, such as a significant reduction in neprilysin activity, aminopeptidases, dipeptidyl peptidases, and glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like were up-regulated in the progression of aging, and a proportion of Aβ1-42 may be processed to Aβ3pE-42. Our findings suggest that anti-Aβ therapies are more effective if given before Aβ3pE-42 deposition."

Present in a variety of biological fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, blood, saliva, and nasal lavage fluid (NLF), exosomes underscore their potential as integral mediators of AD pathology. By serving as vehicles for disease-specific molecules, exosomes could unveil valuable insights into disease identification and progression. This study emphasizes the imperative to investigate the impacts of exosomes on neural networks to enhance our comprehension of intracerebral neuronal communication and its implications for neurological disorders like AD. After harvesting exosomes derived from NLF of 5XFAD mice, we utilized a high-density multielectrode array (HD-MEA) system, the novel technology enabling concurrent recordings from thousands of neurons in primary cortical neuron cultures and organotypic hippocampal slices. The ensuing results revealed a surge in neuronal firing rates and disoriented neural connectivity, reflecting the effects provoked by pathological amyloid-beta oligomer treatment. The local field potentials in the exosome-treated hippocampal brain slices also exhibited aberrant rhythmicity, along with an elevated level of current source density. While this research is an initial exploration, it highlights the potential of exosomes in modulating neural networks under AD conditions and endorses the HD-MEA as an efficacious tool for exosome studies."

We developed a screening platform, ATRIVIEW<sup>®</sup>, for molecules that activate neuronal differentiation of adult mouse NSCs. The most potent hit from an FDA-approved drug library was SNR1611 (trametinib), a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor. We found that trametinib increases the levels of P15<sup>INK4b</sup> and Neurog2, suggesting a mechanism by which MEK1/2 inhibition induces neuronal differentiation. Oral administration of trametinib increased adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone of the 5XFAD AD mouse model. Surprisingly, we also found that trametinib enhanced adult neurogenesis in the cortex. Consequently, trametinib rescued AD pathologies such as neuronal loss and cognitive impairment in 5XFAD mice. Finally, trametinib induced neurogenic differentiation of NSCs derived from AD patient iPSCs, which suggests its potential therapeutic application. Altogether, we suggest that restoration of endogenous adult neurogenesis by trametinib may be a promising therapeutic approach to AD."

The precise molecular profile of AD onset with insight for major pathological contributors remains unclear with corresponding impedances in therapeutic development. The current study sought two objectives, as (i) to resolve the molecular pathogenesis from cognitive impairment to the onset of AD-like neuropathology and (ii) whether the novel agent cannabidiol (CBD), noted for its neuroprotective effects, influences the molecular transition associated with AD onset.<h4>Methods</h4>Dietary CBD was administered daily (80-100 mg/kg/day) in male <i>3xTg-AD</i> mice and wild-type B6129SF2/J animals from 4.5 to 6.5 mo of age with inclusion of vehicle controls. RNA sequencing encompassed longitudinal and cross-sectional blood and brain samples, respectively. Metabolomics and behavioral analyses examined brain regions (cortex, hippocampus) and associated integrated neurocircuitry.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>There were >1,000 differentially expressed markers of AD onset, whereby >75% were either eliminated or reversed in the direction of expression in response to CBD. Signaling pathways encompassed synaptic development and plasticity (e.g., Foxp2), neurovascular interactions (Smad9, Angptl6), receptors and ion channels (Gria4, Chrna2, Rgs7/Rgs7bp), mitochondrial genes (Ndufa7, Cox7a2), immunity (Ncr1), oxidation-reduction (Esr1), lipid synthesis (Fasn, ApoE), and carbohydrate metabolism (Mafa, Mlxipl). As potentially addressable with CBD treatment, AD onset represents molecular integration of neurovascular interactions, channelopathies, metabolic disturbances, and aberrations in developmental genes with involvement of major pathological contributors such as inflammation, oxidative signaling, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance."

In addition, we investigated whether the hippocampal neurodegeneration and object memory impairments shown in 5XFAD mice were mediated by changes to pKr-2 up-regulation.<h4>Key results</h4>Our results demonstrated that pKr-2 was up-regulated in the hippocampi of patients with AD and 5XFAD mice, but was not associated with amyloid-β aggregation in 5XFAD mice. The up-regulation of pKr-2 expression was inhibited by preservation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via addition of caffeine to their water supply or by treatment with rivaroxaban, an inhibitor of factor Xa that is associated with thrombin production. Moreover, the prevention of up-regulation of pKr-2 expression reduced neurotoxic symptoms, such as hippocampal neurodegeneration and object recognition decline due to neurotoxic inflammatory responses in 5XFAD mice.<h4>Conclusion and implications</h4>We identified a novel pathological mechanism of AD mediated by abnormal accumulation of pKr-2, which functions as an important pathogenic factor in the adult brain via blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. Thus, pKr-2 represents a novel target for AD therapeutic strategies and those for related conditions."

It is known that the microbiota-gut-brain-axis plays a role in the pathogenesis, but the pathways are not fully understood yet. To elucidate the role of dietary fibre supplementation on this axis in a 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer´s disease, a feeding trial with an inulin supplement was conducted. At the start (Basis, n = 11) and after 7 weeks with (AD + F; n = 15) and without (AD; n = 15) supplementation, the mice were sacrificed and the following samples were taken: ingesta for 16 S rRNA sequencing and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis, and brain tissue for amyloid-beta staining and proteome analysis. The microbiota patterns in stomach, small intestine, caecum and colon differed between AD and AD + F. SCFA concentrations were significantly higher in group AD + F as compared to AD and Basis. In the AD mice, plaque load was significantly increased as compared to Basis, while a reduction in AD + F as compared to AD was observed. The brain proteome also differed between AD + F and AD, indicating a beneficial effect of the inulin supplementation, possibly mediated in part by microbial acetate. Since prebiotic substances like inulin are also part of human diets, this should be investigated further in the translational context."
